Title: Adidas to remove the number 44 from Germany's shirt because of its resemblance to Nazi symbology

The numbers are too reminiscent of the SS rune used by the National Socialists, the banned symbol of Hitler's 'Schutzstaffel'

The relationship between the sports brand Adidas and the German national football team is once again on the front pages of all German newspapers.

This time it is not because of the end of the historical relationship between the two entities as Germany decides to move to Nike, but because of an issue related to Nazi symbology.

The German brand has announced that it will remove the number 44 from its clothing options for the national team because the font chosen for the numbers is too reminiscent of the SS rune used by the National Socialists, the forbidden symbol of Adolf Hitler's 'Schutzstaffel'.

What is the SS?
The SS was a paramilitary organization under the rule of Hitler and the nazi party. It was the agency of security, surveillance and state terrorism and played a huge role in the holocaust, as well as other attrocities.

One of the brand's spokesmen, Oliver Bruggen, has spoken to Bild, the German daily newspaper to clarify the situation.

"The DFB and its partner 11teamsports are responsible for the design of the names and numbers. We have blocked personalization of the jerseys in our online store. People from around 100 nations work at adidas, our company stands for the promotion of diversity and inclusion, and as a company we actively campaign against xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence and hatred in all forms. Any attempts to promote divisive or exclusionary views are not part of our values as a brand and we strongly reject any suggestions that this was our intention. Our company stands for promoting diversity and inclusion," he said.
